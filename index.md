## 18-1. New Projects
To get a better idea of what Django does, build a couple of empty projects and look at what Django creates. Make a new folder with a simple name, like snap_gram or insta_chat (outside of your learning_log directory), navigate to that folder in a terminal, and create a virtual environment. Install Django and run the command django-admin.py startproject snap_gram . (make sure you include the dot at the end of the command). Look at the files and folders this command creates, and compare them to Learning Log. Do this a few times until youâ€™re familiar with what Django creates when starting a new project. Then delete the project directories if you wish.
